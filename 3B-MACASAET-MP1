Machine Problem No. 1: Create Github Repository for the subject.
Objective:
Familiarize students with various applications of machine learning in real-world scenarios.
Instructions:
1. Research and Identify Applications:
o Select at least three different domains where machine learning is applied (e.g., healthc
marketing).
o Research and identify a specific machine learning application within each selected dom
2. Create a Presentation:
o Slide 1: Introduction
▪ Briefly introduce machine learning and its growing importance in various industries
o Slide 2: Application 1
▪ Problem Being Solved: Describe the specific problem the machine learning
addresses in the first domain.
▪ Type of Machine Learning Used: Specify whether the application uses supervised, u
or reinforcement learning.
▪ Impact of the Solution: Discuss the impact the machine learning solution has had on
or organization, including any measurable outcomes or benefits.
o Slide 3: Application 2
▪ Follow the same format as Slide 2 for the second application in a different domain.
o Slide 4: Application 3
▪ Follow the same format as Slide 2 for the third application in yet another domain.
o Slide 5: Conclusion
▪ Summarize the key points from the three applications, highlighting the versatility and impact of
machine learning across different fields.
3. Presentation Submission:
o Save your presentation in PDF format.
o Submit the PDF file to the designated folder on the course management system by the end of the
week.
4. Class Discussion:
o Be prepared to present your findings in class.
o Engage in a discussion on the significance of machine learning in the modern world, drawing on
examples from your research.
